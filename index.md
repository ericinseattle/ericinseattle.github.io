Hello, my name is Eric. I currently work as a functional analyst.

What exactly do I do? Basically I work with all types of data whether it be through SQL queries, user interviews, and/or documentation materials in order to generate meaningful insights so that people can act and make informed decisions based on the data.

Feel free to take a look at some of the projects I have done for class and in my free time. If you wish to contact me, my email is listed below.
