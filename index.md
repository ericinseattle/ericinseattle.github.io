Hello, my name is Eric. I am a functional analyst. What does this mean? Basically, I analyze a lot of data. This could be tabular data like in a database or it could be data on user requirements and requests. My role is to compile all of this data whether it be through SQL queries, user interviews, and/or parsing documentation and make meaningful insights so that people can act and make informed decisions.

Feel free to take a look at some of the projects I have done outside of work. If you wish to contact me, my email is listed below.
