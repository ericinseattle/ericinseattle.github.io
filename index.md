Hello, my name is Eric and I work as a functional analyst.

What exactly do I do? Basically I work with both quantitative and qualitative data in order to generate meaningful insights so that people can act and make informed decisions based on the data.

Feel free to take a look at some of the projects I have done for class and in my free time. If you wish to contact me, please send an email or message via LinkedIn.
